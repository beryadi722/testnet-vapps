## Project

### Name & Category
- Project: zk-DeFi Credit Scoring
- Category: defi

### Description
- zk-DeFi Credit Scoring is a decentralized credit rating system that enables users to prove their financial solvency, repayment history, and transaction reputation without exposing sensitive wallet balances or private financial details. The goal is to bring trust and fairness into DeFi lending markets with a privacy-first approach.

### SL Integration
- Soundness Layer will be used to generate zkProofs of creditworthiness. Users can prove conditions such as "wallet has repaid X loans," "average balance exceeded Y over Z months," or "no defaults recorded," without revealing raw transaction data. Lenders can then trust these proofs for loan approvals, collateral reduction, or preferential rates

## Technical

### Architecture
1. User links wallet and optionally external identity (GitHub/DAO/DeFi history).
2. Smart contract requests solvency proof.
3. SL generates zkProof for conditions (e.g., solvency, no default, repayment history).
4. Credit score NFT or verifiable credential issued to the user.
5. Lenders query credit score proofs before issuing loans.
### Stack
- Solidity smart contracts (loan + scoring contracts)
- Soundness Layer SDK / CLI
- IPFS or Ceramic for encrypted credentials
- Next.js + Ethers.js frontend

### Features
1. zkProof-based solvency verification (without showing wallet balance).
2. On-chain credit scoring contract issuing scores as NFTs or credentials.
3. Portable DeFi credit badge usable across multiple platforms.
4. Integration API for lending protocols to query zkProof-based scores.

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Design credit scoring logic (basic solvency check).
- [ ] Implement smart contract for credit score proof submission.
- [ ] Integrate SL zkProof for solvency (balance > threshold).
- [ ] Build simple dashboard to request and view score.

### MVP (4-8 weeks)  
- [ ] Expand proof logic (repayment history, no defaults).
- [ ] Issue credit score NFTs / credentials.
- [ ] API for external DeFi lenders to query scores.
- [ ] Multi-chain support (EVM-compatible).

## Innovation
- zk-DeFi Credit Scoring provides a new layer of trust for DeFi lenders and borrowers. It enables privacy-preserving creditworthiness checks, reducing collateral requirements and opening access to under-collateralized loans without sacrificing user privacy. Unlike centralized credit systems, this model is decentralized, user-owned, and composable with other dApps.
